# Flask Dream Journal
## Casey Lewis

This is my dream journal project for IMM 230: Dynamic Web Applications.

It is based on the Flask Mega-Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg.

## Progress Journal

SESSION ONE (10/21)

So far, I have found this project fascinating. The combination of flask, python and Jinja2 can do some
amazing things that I had no idea about. It is able to accomplish so much with minimal lines of code.
This session I finished chapters 1-3 of the tutorial (startup, templates, and login).

SESSION TWO (10/28)

Working with databases was very interesting. The article was super helpful for explaining how they work
and the pros + cons of different types of databases. This session I finished chapter 4 of the tutorial (databases).

SESSION THREE (10/29)

Worked on login and registration functionalities. This was a lot more complicated and complex than anything
covered in the previous chapters. This session I finished chapter 5 of the tutorial (User Logins).
